# GridViewRemoveIssue

## Issue: 
  Transition applied on 'remove' property not working, except for the last element. 
  
  The number transition works if the transition is applied on x/y properties but does not work for 'scale'. I can see the scale transition only when I add a 'removeDisplaced' property.
  
  ColorAnimation does not work.
